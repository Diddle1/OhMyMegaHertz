## ESP32 + CC1101 with LVGL Touch Support
I tested various touch libraries, and the only one that allowed the CC1101 to work correctly was LVGL.
I know this may look messy, but I figured I'd share it so others can improve or use it as they please.

# Setup Instructions
1. Install Arduino IDE
Make sure you have the Arduino IDE installed before proceeding.

2. Install ESP32 Board Support
Open Arduino IDE.
Go to File > Preferences.
In the Additional Boards Manager URLs field, enter:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json
Click OK and restart the Arduino IDE.
3. Use the Correct ESP32 Version
The test phase is using ESP32 v2.0.14.
Versions above 2.0.14 may not work correctly.
If you experience issues, downgrade to 2.0.14 or lower.
ðŸ’¡ Note: As of 2024/08/02, TFT_eSPI does not work on versions higher than 2.0.14 (Issue #3329).
